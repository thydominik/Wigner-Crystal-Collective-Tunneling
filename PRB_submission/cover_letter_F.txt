Dear Editor,

Please, find enclosed our manuscript "Collective Wigner crystal tunneling in 
carbon nanotubes," which we submit for publication in Physical Review B as a regular paper.

The Wigner crystal – originally proposed by Eugene Wigner in 1934 – is an extraordinary 
state of matter that emerges in a sufficiently dilute electron gas in the presence of Coulomb interaction.  
The Coulomb interaction is so strong in this limit, that it destroys the electron liquid, and
electrons localize and form a crystalline pattern. This quantum crystal exhibits intriguing phenomena. 
In particular, in a recent experiment, the quantum tunneling  of a small, one-dimensional electron 
crystal has been observed [Shapir et al, Science 364, 870 (2019)]. 

Our goal in this work is to analyze and understand the crystal's collective tunneling, and provide a detailed 
theoretical description of this complex phenomenon. By combining Density Matrix Renormalization Group computations, exact diagonalization, and instanton theory, we present a complete theoretical framework, and provide an accurate 
theoretical description of the experiments. 

Our results, as well as the experiments, reflect certain universal properties of the collective tunneling process, 
observed through a scaling collapse of the experimental and theoretical curves for different crystal sizes. 
We also demonstrate the effect of the crystal's quantum fluctuations, which reduce the barrier height and increase 
the amplitude of collective tunneling substantially.

We are confident that these results will captivate the readership of Physical Review B, 
which appears to us as the most appropriate journal to publish them. 

Yours sincerely,

D. Szombathy, C.P. Moca, and G. Zarand, for the authors
