abstract = {The physics of interacting quantum wires has attracted a lot of attention recently. When the density of electrons in the wire is very low, the strong repulsion between electrons leads to the formation of a Wigner crystal. We review the rich spin and orbital properties of the Wigner crystal, in both the one-dimensional and the quasi-one-dimensional regimes. In the one-dimensional Wigner crystal the electron spins form an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with exponentially small exchange coupling. In the presence of leads, the resulting inhomogeneity of the electron density causes a violation of spin–charge separation. As a consequence the spin degrees of freedom affect the conductance of the wire. Upon increasing the electron density, the Wigner crystal starts deviating from the strictly one-dimensional geometry, forming a zigzag structure instead. Spin interactions in this regime are dominated by ring exchanges, and the phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has a number of unpolarized phases as well as regions of complete and partial spin polarization. Finally we address the orbital properties in the vicinity of the transition from a one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional state. Due to the locking between chains in the zigzag Wigner crystal, only one gapless mode exists. Manifestations of Wigner crystal physics at weak interactions are explored by studying the fate of the additional gapped low-energy mode as a function of interaction strength.}

@article{Chen2006,
	abstract = {The melting temperature Tm of a solid is generally determined by its solid--liquid transition on being heated at a fixed pressure, usually ambient pressure. It is also determined indirectly by the density n by means of the equation of state. This remains true even for solid helium1, in which quantum effects often lead to unusual properties2. Here, we present experimental evidence to show that for a two-dimensional (2D) solid formed by electrons in a semiconductor sample under a strong perpendicular magnetic field3 (B), Tm is not controlled by n, but effectively by the quantum correlation between the electrons through the Landau level filling factor ν=n h/e B (where h is the Planck constant and e is the electronic charge). Such melting behaviour, different from that of all other known solids (including a classical 2D electron solid at zero magnetic field4), suggests the quantum nature of the magnetic-field-induced electron solid. Moreover, Tm increases with the strength of the sample-dependent disorder that tends to pin the electron solid in place.},

@article{Zhou2021,
	abstract = {One of the first theoretically predicted manifestations of strong interactions in many-electron systems was the Wigner crystal1--3, in which electrons crystallize into a regular lattice. The crystal can melt via either thermal or quantum fluctuations4. Quantum melting of the Wigner crystal is predicted to produce exotic intermediate phases5,6 and quantum magnetism7,8 because of the intricate interplay of Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy. However, studying two-dimensional Wigner crystals in the quantum regime has often required a strong magnetic field9--11 or a moir{\'e}superlattice potential12--15, thus limiting access to the full phase diagram of the interacting electron liquid. Here we report the observation of bilayer Wigner crystals without magnetic fields or moir{\'e}potentials in an atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, which consists of two MoSe2 monolayers separated by hexagonal boron nitride. We observe optical signatures of robust correlated insulating states at symmetric (1:1) and asymmetric (3:1, 4:1 and 7:1) electron doping of the two MoSe2 layers at cryogenic temperatures. We attribute these features to bilayer Wigner crystals composed of two interlocked commensurate triangular electron lattices, stabilized by inter-layer interaction16. The Wigner crystal phases are remarkably stable, and undergo quantum and thermal melting transitions at electron densities of up to 6 ×1012 per square centimetre and at temperatures of up to about 40 kelvin. Our results demonstrate that an atomically thin heterostructure is a highly tunable platform for realizing many-body electronic states and probing their liquid--solid and magnetic quantum phase transitions4--8,17.},

Efforts to observe2--12 this elusive state of matter, termed a Wigner crystal, in two-dimensional extended systems have primarily focused on conductivity measurements on electrons confined to a single Landau level at high magnetic fields. Here we use optical spectroscopy to demonstrate that electrons in a monolayer semiconductor with density lower than 3 ×1011 per centimetre squared form a Wigner crystal. The combination of a high electron effective mass and reduced dielectric screening enables us to observe electronic charge order even in the absence of a moir{\'e}potential or an external magnetic field. The interactions between a resonantly injected exciton and electrons arranged in a periodic lattice modify the exciton bandstructure so that an umklapp resonance arises in the optical reflection spectrum, heralding the presence of charge order13. Our findings demonstrate that charge-tunable transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers14 enable the investigation of previously uncharted territory for many-body physics where interaction energy dominates over kinetic energy.},

An analysis of the electronic transport provides evidence for competing correlated metallic and insulating states with varying degrees of spin polarization. Some features bear quantitative resemblance to quantum Monte Carlo simulation results, including the transition point from the paramagnetic Fermi liquid to Wigner crystal and the absence of a Stoner transition. At very low temperatures, we resolve a non-monotonic spin polarizability of electrons across the phase transition, pointing towards a low spin phase of electrons, and a two-order-of-magnitude positive magnetoresistance that is challenging to understand within traditional metallic transport paradigms.

Transition metal dichalcogenide moir{\'e}heterostructures provide another model system for the study of correlated quantum phenomena5 because of their strong light--matter interactions and large spin--orbit coupling. However, experimental observation of correlated insulating states in this system is challenging with traditional transport techniques. Here we report the optical detection of strongly correlated phases in semiconducting WSe2/WS2 moir{\'e}superlattices. We use a sensitive optical detection technique and reveal a Mott insulator state at one hole per superlattice site and surprising insulating phases at 1/3 and 2/3 filling of the superlattice, which we assign to generalized Wigner crystallization on the underlying lattice6--11. Furthermore, the spin--valley optical selection rules12--14 of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures allow us to optically create and investigate low-energy excited spin states in the Mott insulator. We measure a very long spin relaxation lifetime of many microseconds in the Mott insulating state, orders of magnitude longer than that of charge excitations.

	abstract = {Partially filled Landau levels host competing electronic orders. For example, electron solids may prevail close to integer filling of the Landau levels before giving way to fractional quantum Hall liquids at higher carrier density1,2. Here, we report the observation of an electron solid with non-collinear spin texture in monolayer graphene, consistent with solidification of skyrmions3---topological spin textures characterized by quantized electrical charge4,5. We probe the spin texture of the solids using a modified Corbino geometry that allows ferromagnetic magnons to be launched and detected6,7. We find that magnon transport is highly efficient when one Landau level is filled ({\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}nu =1{\$}{\$}), consistent with quantum Hall ferromagnetic spin polarization. However, even minimal doping immediately quenches the magnon signal while leaving the vanishing low-temperature charge conductivity unchanged. Our results can be understood by the formation of a solid of charged skyrmions near {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}nu =1{\$}{\$}, whose non-collinear spin texture leads to rapid magnon decay. Data near fractional fillings show evidence of several fractional skyrmion solids, suggesting that graphene hosts a highly tunable landscape of coupled spin and charge orders.},

	abstract = {Quantum particles on a lattice with competing long-range interactions are ubiquitous in physics; transition metal oxides1,2, layered molecular crystals3 and trapped-ion arrays4 are a few examples. In the strongly interacting regime, these systems often show a rich variety of quantum many-body ground states that challenge theory2. The emergence of transition metal dichalcogenide moir{\'e}superlattices provides a highly controllable platform in which to study long-range electronic correlations5--12. Here we report an observation of nearly two dozen correlated insulating states at fractional fillings of tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide moir{\'e}superlattices. This finding is enabled by a new optical sensing technique that is based on the sensitivity to the dielectric environment of the exciton excited states in a single-layer semiconductor of tungsten diselenide. The cascade of insulating states shows an energy ordering that is nearly symmetric about a filling factor of half a particle per superlattice site. We propose a series of charge-ordered states at commensurate filling fractions that range from generalized Wigner crystals7 to charge density waves. Our study lays the groundwork for using moir{\'e}superlattices to simulate a wealth of quantum many-body problems that are described by the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model3,13,14 or spin models with long-range charge--charge and exchange interactions15,16.},

	abstract = {The Wigner crystal1 has fascinated condensed matter physicists for nearly 90 years2--14. Signatures of two-dimensional (2D) Wigner crystals were first observed in 2D electron gases under high magnetic field2--4, and recently reported in transition metal dichalcogenide moir{\'e}superlattices6--9. Direct observation of the 2D Wigner crystal lattice in real space, however, has remained an outstanding challenge. Conventional scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has sufficient spatial resolution but induces perturbations that can potentially alter this fragile state. Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of 2D Wigner crystals in WSe2/WS2 moir{\'e}heterostructures using a specially designed non-invasive STM spectroscopy technique. This employs a graphene sensing layer held close to the WSe2/WS2 moir{\'e}superlattice. Local STM tunnel current into the graphene layer is modulated by the underlying Wigner crystal electron lattice in the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Different Wigner crystal lattice configurations at fractional electron fillings of n = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3, where n is the electron number per site, are directly visualized. The n = 1/3 and n = 2/3 Wigner crystals exhibit triangular and honeycomb lattices, respectively, to minimize nearest-neighbour occupations. The n = 1/2 state spontaneously breaks the original C3 symmetry and forms a stripe phase. Our study lays a solid foundation for understanding Wigner crystal states in WSe2/WS2 moir{\'e}heterostructures and provides an approach that is generally applicable for imaging novel correlated electron lattices in other systems.},

For example, metallic carbon nanotubes1 are quantum wires that have been found to act as one-dimensional quantum dots2,3, Luttinger liquids4,5, proximity-induced superconductors6,7 and ballistic8 and diffusive9 one-dimensional metals. Here we report that electrically contacted single-walled carbon nanotubes can serve as powerful probes of Kondo physics, demonstrating the universality of the Kondo effect. Arising in the prototypical case from the interaction between a localized impurity magnetic moment and delocalized electrons in a metallic host, the Kondo effect has been used to explain10 enhanced low-temperature scattering from magnetic impurities in metals, and also occurs in transport through semiconductor quantum dots11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. The far greater tunability of dots (in our case, nanotubes) compared with atomic impurities renders new classes of Kondo-like effects19,20 accessible. Our nanotube devices differ from previous systems in which Kondo effects have been observed, in that they are one-dimensional quantum dots with three-dimensional metal (gold) reservoirs. This allows us to observe Kondo resonances for very large electron numbers (N) in the dot, and approaching the unitary limit (where the transmission reaches its maximum possible value). Moreover, we detect a previously unobserved Kondo effect, occurring for even values of N in a magnetic field.},

When the transparency was tuned to be low, signatures of Andreev reflection disappeared and only tunneling conduction was observed.

abstract = {An effective continuum/finite element (FE) approach for modeling the structure and the deformation of single- and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is presented. Individual tubes are modeled using shell elements, where a specific pairing of elastic properties and mechanical thickness of the tube wall is identified to enable successful modeling with shell theory. The incorporation and role of an initial internal distributed stress through the thickness of the wall, due to the cylindrical nature of the tube, are discussed. The effects of van der Waals forces, crucial in multi-wall nanotubes and in tube/tube or tube/substrate interactions, are simulated by the construction of special interaction elements. The success of this new CNT modeling approach is verified by first comparing simulations of deformation of single-wall nanotubes with molecular dynamics results available in the literature. Simulations of final deformed configurations, as well strain energy histories, are in excellent agreement with the atomistic models for various deformations. The approach was then applied to the bending of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and the deformed configurations were compared to corresponding high-resolution images from experiments. The proposed approach successfully predicts the experimentally observed wavelengths and shapes of the wrinkles that develop in bent MWNTs, a complex phenomenon dominated by inter-layer interactions. Presented results demonstrate that the proposed FE technique could provide a valuable tool for studying the mechanical behavior of MWNTs as single entities, as well as their effectiveness as load-bearing entities in nanocomposite materials.}

abstract = {We present an error analysis of the symmetric Lanczos algorithm in finite precision arithmetic. The loss of orthogonality among the computed Lanczos vectors is explained with the help of a recurrence formula. A backward error analysis shows that semiorthogonality among the Lanczos vectors is enough to guarantee the accuracy of the computed quantities up to machine precision. The results of this analysis are then extended to the more general case of the Lanczos algorithm with a semiorthogonalization strategy. Based on the recurrence formula, a new reorthogonalization method called partial reorthogonalization is introduced. We show that both partial reorthogonalization and selective orthogonalization as introduced by Parlett and Scott [15] are semiorthogonalization strategies. Finally we discuss the application of our results to the solution of linear systems of equations and to the eigenvalue problem.}

journal = {Europhysics Letters},
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach combining linear response theory (Kubo) for the conductance and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). The system considered is one-dimensional and consists of non-interacting tight-binding leads coupled to an interacting nanostructure via weak links. Electrons are treated as spinless fermions and two different correlation functions are used to evaluate the conductance. Exact diagonalization calculations in the non-interacting limit serve as a benchmark for our combined Kubo and DMRG approach in this limit. Including both weak and strong interaction we present DMRG results for an extended nanostructure consisting of seven sites. For the strongly interacting structure a simple explanation of the position of the resonances is given in terms of hard-core particles moving freely on a lattice of reduced size.}

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.}

abstract = {A precise characterization of structures occurring in turbulent fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers is one of the last open problems of classical physics. In this review we discuss recent developments related to the application of instanton methods to turbulence. Instantons are saddle point configurations of the underlying path integrals. They are equivalent to minimizers of the related Freidlin–Wentzell action and known to be able to characterize rare events in such systems. While there is an impressive body of work concerning their analytical description, this review focuses on the question on how to compute these minimizers numerically. In a short introduction we present the relevant mathematical and physical background before we discuss the stochastic Burgers equation in detail. We present algorithms to compute instantons numerically by an efficient solution of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations. A second focus is the discussion of a recently developed numerical filtering technique that allows to extract instantons from direct numerical simulations. In the following we present modifications of the algorithms to make them efficient when applied to two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) fluid dynamical problems. We illustrate these ideas using the 2D Burgers equation and the 3D Navier–Stokes equations.}

@article{Waissman.2013,
	abstract = {The ability to tune local parameters of quantum Hamiltonians has been demonstrated in experimental systems including ultracold atoms1, trapped ions2, superconducting circuits3 and photonic crystals4. Such systems possess negligible disorder, enabling local tunability. Conversely, in condensed-matter systems, electrons are subject to disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated phases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a disorder-free and locally-tunable condensed-matter system thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of locally-tunable, ultralow-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes suspended over complex electronic circuits. Using transport experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location to location. The high mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about the nanotube centre establishes the negligible effects of electronic disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision-engineered one-dimensional potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes at chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional systems. These capabilities could enable many novel experiments on electronics, mechanics and spins in one dimension.},

@article{Pecker.2013,
	abstract = {Two electrons on a string form a simple model system where Coulomb interactions are expected to play an interesting role. In the presence of strong interactions, these electrons are predicted to form a Wigner molecule, separating to the ends of the string. This spatial structure is believed to be clearly imprinted on the energy spectrum, yet so far a direct measurement of such a spectrum in a controllable one-dimensional setting is still missing. Here we use an ultraclean carbon nanotube to realize this system in a tunable potential. Using tunnelling spectroscopy we measure the addition spectra of two interacting carriers, electrons or holes, and identify seven low-energy states characterized by their exchange symmetries. The formation of a Wigner molecule is evident from a tenfold quenching of the fundamental excitation energy as compared with the non-interacting value. Our ability to tune the two-carrier state in space and to study it for both electrons and holes provides an unambiguous demonstration of this strongly interacting quantum ground state.},

In an axial magnetic field, we observe three distinct regimes of spin and isospin polarization as carrier density is varied. We explain these regimes in terms of a Wigner crystal picture based on a gapped Luttinger liquid model, with the carriers represented by spatially localized solitons. Our observations could enable greater control over the behaviour of the spatially separated system of carriers. Such control, combined with the inherently long coherence times of carriers in carbon nanotubes, could prove useful in the development of solid-state quantum computing.},

In the case of multi-wall nanotubes, where many tubes are arranged in a coaxial fashion, the electrical properties of individual tubes have been shown to vary strongly from tube to tube2,3, and to be characterized by disorder and localization4. Single-wall nanotubes5,6 (SWNTs) have recently been obtained with high yields and structural uniformity7. Particular varieties of these highly symmetric structures have been predicted to be metallic, with electrical conduction occurring through only two electronic modes8--10. Because of the structural symmetry and stiffness of SWNTs, their molecular wavefunctions may extend over the entire tube. Here we report electrical transport measurements on individual single-wall nanotubes that confirm these theoretical predictions. We find that SWNTs indeed act as genuine quantum wires. Electrical conduction seems to occur through well separated, discrete electron states that are quantum-mechanically coherent over long distance, that is at least from contact to contact (140nm). Data in a magnetic field indicate shifting of these states due to the Zeeman effect.},

These are based mainly on the techniques of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the Young's moduli of single-wall nanotube bundles and multi-walled nanotubes, prepared by a number of methods. These results are confirming the theoretical predictions that carbon nanotubes have high strength plus extraordinary flexibility and resilience. As well as summarising the most notable achievements of theory and experiment in the last few years, this paper explains the properties of nanotubes in the wider context of materials science and highlights the contribution of our research group in this rapidly expanding field. A deeper understanding of the relationship between the structural order of the nanotubes and their mechanical properties will be necessary for the development of carbon-nanotube-based composites. Our research to date illustrates a qualitative relationship between the Young's modulus of a nanotube and the amount of disorder in the atomic structure of the walls. Other exciting results indicate that composites will benefit from the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, but that the major outstanding problem of load transfer efficiency must be overcome before suitable engineering materials can be produced.},

@article{Bockrath.1999,
	abstract = {Electron transport in conductors is usually well described by Fermi-liquid theory, which assumes that the energy states of the electrons near the Fermi level EF are not qualitatively altered by Coulomb interactions. In one-dimensional systems, however, even weak Coulomb interactions cause strong perturbations. The resulting system, known as a Luttinger liquid, is predicted to be distinctly different from its two- and three-dimensional counterparts1. For example, tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid at energies near the Fermi level is predicted to be strongly suppressed, unlike in two- and three-dimensional metals. Experiments on one-dimensional semiconductor wires2, 2,3 have been interpreted by using Luttinger-liquid theory, but an unequivocal verification of the theoretical predictions has not yet been obtained. Similarly, the edge excitations seen in fractional quantum Hall conductors are consistent with Luttinger-liquid behaviour4, 5, but recent experiments failed to confirm the predicted relationship between the electrical properties of the bulk state and those of the edge states6. Electrically conducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) represent quantum wires7,8,9,10 that may exhibit Luttinger-liquid behaviour11, 12. Here we present measurements of the conductance of bundles (`ropes') of SWNTs as a function of temperature and voltage that agree with predictions for tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid. In particular, we find that the conductance and differential conductance scale as power laws with respect to temperature and bias voltage, respectively, and that the functional forms and the exponents are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

journal={Nature Communications},
year={2019},
volume={10},
number={1},
pages={381},
abstract={Illumination of atoms by resonant lasers can pump electrons into a coherent superposition of hyperfine levels which can no longer absorb the light. Such superposition is known as a dark state, because fluorescent light emission is then suppressed. Here we report an all-electric analogue of this destructive interference effect in a carbon nanotube quantum dot. The dark states are a coherent superposition of valley (angular momentum) states which are decoupled from either the drain or the source leads. Their emergence is visible in asymmetric current-voltage characteristics, with missing current steps and current suppression which depend on the polarity of the applied source-drain bias. Our results demonstrate coherent-population trapping by all-electric means in an artificial atom.},
